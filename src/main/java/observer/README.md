The Observer Pattern
--------------------

Welcome to the Observer pattern, this example demonstrates the ability to have an Observer object informed when a Subject
object is altered.

The example has been abstracted from a specific example to use classes that are named in such a way to demonstrate their
purpose in the Observer Pattern.

This example can be run using the main method in the application class and has a few prompts to make it interactive.
